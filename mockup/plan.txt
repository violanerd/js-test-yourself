* to continue/ to do

1. Write questions
2. What should come first? HTML, then javascript for proof of concept
    
3. Parts of the website:
    a. questions, that are dynamically loaded depending on:
        - click event.. <-- this is working now *flesh out this logic
    b. * css that styles the questions
    c. * local storage holding the high score
    d. * timer that counts down
        - subtract if incorrect
    e. * logic that checks if the answer is correct
        - triggers the timer to subtract if incorrect
        - triggers a correct or incorrect button at the bottom that displays for a short amount of time
        - triggers the next question after a set amount of time
    * f. start screen <-- this is where I am working now
    g. * end screen

PLAN

1. Create Variables to store the questions. 
    - create an object for each question
        -- how to store the answers so I know which one is correct??? 
        --> put an array into the object
    - store the objects in an array
    -check that I can see them in the console
    * continue here
2. mock up html/css to see if I can 
    screen shot to get wireframe
    draw it out
        * end screen
    display the questions
    iterate through

3. Start screen work
    - css develop
    - text
4. Questions page

5. End screen with local storage

6. Timer
